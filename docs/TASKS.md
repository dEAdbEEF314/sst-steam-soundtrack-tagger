# SST Tasks

---

## Phase 0: Infrastructure

Goal:
- Run a minimal Prefect flow on current Docker environment and confirm SeaweedFS connectivity.

Tasks:
- Setup Prefect server and verify API health.
- Configure SeaweedFS S3 endpoint and credentials.
- Confirm bucket and prefixes:
	- bucket: sst
	- prefixes: ingest/, archive/, review/, workspace/
- Setup Docker nodes (core/scout/worker) with shared network reachability.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Prefect API is reachable from worker container.
- Worker can execute S3 ListBuckets/PutObject/GetObject.
- A test object is written and read successfully under workspace/.

---

## Phase 1: Scout

Goal:
- Collect Steam metadata required for album candidate narrowing.

Tasks:
- Implement Steam metadata fetch (AppID, localized title, release date).
- Implement browser-use integration only where API data is insufficient.
- Normalize localized/original titles for downstream search.
- Output JSON contract consumable by core flow.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Given app_id, scout returns deterministic metadata JSON.
- Missing fields are explicitly marked and logged.

---

## Phase 2: Core

Goal:
- Orchestrate full pipeline as Prefect flow with deterministic retries and state transitions.

Tasks:
- Define flow entry parameters:
	- app_id: int
	- files: list[str]
- Implement task graph:
	- fetch_steam_metadata
	- search_musicbrainz
	- score_candidates
	- partial_acoustid_verify
	- full_acoustid_fallback
	- write_tags
	- persist_results
- Configure retry policy via config:
	- retry.max_attempts
	- retry.base_delay_sec
- Enforce rule: partial verification failure must escalate to full AcoustID.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Flow runs can be triggered manually and from deployment.
- Failure/retry behavior matches docs/ERROR_HANDLING.md and docs/STATE_MACHINE.md.
- Flow-level output JSON is produced for success and review cases.

## Phase 3: Worker

Goal:
- Implement worker modules and local execution path for one album end-to-end.

Tasks:
- Implement modules:
	- acoustid/
	- fingerprint/
	- musicbrainz/
	- scoring/
	- tagging/
	- pipeline/
	- models/
- Implement fpcalc wrapper and duration extraction.
- Implement candidate scoring and threshold decision.
- Implement tagging with ID3v2.3.
- Implement SeaweedFS persistence:
	- input references from ingest/
	- output to archive/
	- review artifacts to review/
	- transient data to workspace/

Acceptance Criteria:
- One 31-track album completes with tags updated and output JSON written.
- Partial verification failure correctly triggers full fallback.
- Ambiguous/failure runs are persisted to review/.

---

## Phase 4: Integration

Goal:
- Validate production-like behavior for quality, observability, and operability.

Tasks:
- Implement pytest suite for unit and integration tests.
- Execute E2E test set:
	- 1 known correct album
	- 1 ambiguous album
	- 1 failure album
- Validate structured logging fields:
	- job_id, track_id, step, result, error
- Validate retry/backoff and final review routing.
- Add deployment runbook for local operations.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Success criteria in docs/SUCCESS_CRITERIA.md are met.
- Test reports and run artifacts are reproducible.
- Operational runbook allows rerun without manual hidden steps.

---

## Current Priority (MVP)

- Implement Phase 3 first for single-album E2E with manual app_id input.
- Keep Scout optional for MVP; use direct metadata input when needed.
- Complete Phase 2 minimal Prefect orchestration once worker path is stable.
